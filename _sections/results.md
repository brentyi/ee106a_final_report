Our project could autonomously move to each marshmallow laid out arbitrarily on a table, grab them, and feed the subject the marshmallows. Each of these subtasks, like identifying the position of a marshmallow, moving the gripper there, picking up the marshmallow, and moving it back to the detected mouth position, functioned as expected.
